# Logic is a skill
### 02/04/2025

For as long as I can remember, I’ve believed two things about myself:

1. I’m a creative person.
2. I’m not a logical thinker.

Because of that, I decided early on that I didn’t like math. In 9th grade, I skipped IT class — it was boring, and I thought I wasn’t cut out for it.

Now, I’m retraining as a software developer, but I still haven’t uncovered a hidden talent for numbers or logic. 
Instead, I’ve discovered something else: My creativity isn’t just an innate talent; it’s a skill I built through practice. 
I didn’t wake up one day knowing how to draw, paint, or take great photos — I got better because I put in the work.

So why did I assume programming was something I should just "get" instantly? 
Maybe because it doesn’t come as easily to me as photography did. My ADHD brain craves instant results, and coding can feel frustrating, slow, and overwhelming. 
But for the first time, I’m learning to develope a skill that truly requires patience and persistence, that's not just all easy going and fun for me.

It’s tough, but there’s something rewarding about seeing progress. I try to remind myself that mastery doesn’t happen overnight, afterall all the sayings are true. 
When frustration hits, I try not to let it win — I step back, focus on the basics, and take things one step at a time.

*Learning a skill is a marathon, not a sprint. And no one runs a marathon without practice, patience, and a bit of struggle and pain along the way.*
