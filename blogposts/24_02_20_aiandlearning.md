# Learning with ChatGPT
### 20/02/2025

AI is everywhere—and it made building my portfolio website a lot easier. We’ve all heard the downsides (a million times). Yet, here we are, using it. Maybe it's inevitable, like smartphones before it.

I know I shouldn’t rely on AI for everything—coding, learning, pizza recipes, or picking an electricity provider. But let’s be honest: it makes life easier. And pretending it doesn’t exist isn’t an option. So, like with everything, balance is key.

ChatGPT won’t teach me coding if I let it do the work.
So, I ask for hints instead.
It won’t deepen my understanding if I let it summarize everything.
So, I tell it what I know and ask targeted questions.
It won’t sharpen my thinking if I let it solve my problems.
So, I ask how I can practice solving them myself.

The temptation to let AI do everything is real. But I’ve learned that real understanding only comes from struggling through documentation, solving problems, and writing code myself. Still, having an infinitely patient assistant to break things down, provide examples, and answer all my random side questions? Invaluable.

ChatGPT can summarize, structure, and simplify information. 
It can help me see the bigger picture and even provide some (strangely comforting) motivation. 
It can also answer all the unrelated questions that would derail a lesson and certainly annoy everyone else.

AI has its pitfalls, but like my smartphone, it’s just a tool. 

*It’s up to me whether I let it think for me or use it to support my learning. That takes reflection, honesty, and persistence.*
