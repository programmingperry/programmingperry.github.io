# To be programmed
#### To-Do List

- [x] Fully functional portfolio website with responsive design
- [ ] Reading tracker app (that hits my aesthetical perfectionism)
- [ ] Mealplanning and recipe app (where you plan your meals from saved recipes and automatically get a shopping list - surely this exists but all these apps are annoying)
- [ ] Finish console chess (maybe...)
- [ ] Finance tracking & organization tool (that works for me)
- [ ] Notes app messenger style (because I never find the notes I write myself on WhatsApp)
