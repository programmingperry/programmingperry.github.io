    <h1>Perry with AuDHD</h1>
    <h2>I'm currently <s>working</s> procrastinating on my neurospicy neocities space.</h2>

    <p>After years of travelling through internet time and space, visiting far away social media galaxies, with the memories of long-lost blogosphere in the back of my mind, it seems as if I finally landed my spaceship on planet neocities. Could it be all I was looking for all the time? Just as the endlessness of the universe, I'm staring at the blank space in front of me. What to do, what to share - why even care? Well, now that I landed here, I might as well do something with it. It might just take a while - at least the universe wasn't built in a day (or was that Rome?).</p>
    
   
    <p><strong>The (somehow never finished) to do list</strong></p>
    <div class=todo>
    <ul>
      <li>create hyperfixation log</li>
      <li>build coding collection</li>
      <li>write an AuDHD dictionary</li>
      <li>draw a map (not sure why or what for but sounds fancy)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Btw Hi, I'm not Perry - Perry (the platypus) is my unofficial emotional support spirit animal.</p>
