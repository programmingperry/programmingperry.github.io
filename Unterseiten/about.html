    <h1>Hey, <s>who's</s> where's Perry?</h1>
    <div class="about-container">
      
      <p>During my career change into tech, I once asked: "What exactly are peripherals?" <br>
        In English, the answer is clear, but in German, the term spans IT, geography, linguistics, and more—so I was understandably confused. 
        Somehow, peripherals became Perry, and the name stuck.
        <br><br>
        And when I hear Perry, I think of the Disney-show Phineas and Ferb. <br>
        Their teal-coloured platypus seems ordinary but leads a double life as a secret agent, fighting his evil nemesis Dr. Doofenschmirtz.
        Whenever Perry disappears to save the world from Doofenschmirtz' plans, Phineas takes notice of that with the phrase "Hey, where's Perry?"
        
        For me, programming often feels like solving puzzles or even fighting some evil nemesis when code doesn't do what you want it to do — 
        hard and frustrating at times, but rewarding when things finally click. <br><br>
        Perry has become my sort of emotional support / spirit animal; a reminder to find creative solutions and keep going when I'm trapped, when the code doesn’t cooperate.</p>
