    <h2>Hey, where's Perry?</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet!<br>Here, I share my coding journey, projects, and everything I learn along the way.<br> <br> 
During my career change into tech, I once asked: "What exactly are peripherals?"<br>
In English, the answer is clear, but in German, the term spans IT, geography, linguistics, and more—so I was understandably confused. 
Somehow, peripherals became Perry, and the name stuck.<br> 
And when I hear Perry, I think of Phineas and Ferb. Their teal-colored platypus seems ordinary but leads a double life as a special agent, battling his evil nemesis Dr. Doofenschmirtz.<br> <br> 
For me, programming often feels like solving puzzles — frustrating at times, but rewarding when things finally click.<br>  
Perry has become my sort of spirit and emotional support animal.
So, whether you're here to check out my projects or just wondering where Perry is—I hope you enjoy your visit!</p>
