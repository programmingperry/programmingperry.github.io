  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Former photographer, currently retraining to become full time programmer, on a mission to become a well-rounded software developer. From SQL to Python, front- to backend.<br><br>
    While I traded my camera for a keyboard, I still see things in frames â€“ just now it's functions, loops, and databases instead of lenses and light.
    <br><br>
    This blog/portfolio is where I share my journey, projects, and the occasional insight (or bug-induced meltdown). <br><br>Stick around if you're into code, curiosity, and a bit of chaos.
  </p>
