    <h2>Hey, where's Perry?</h2>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>Welcome to my space on the internet, where I intend to share my coding learning journey and my projects along the way.</p>
    <p>When the topic "Hardware" began in school, I had to ask what exactly peripherals are. While this seems pretty clear in english, as far as I can tell, it isn't that simple in German, 
        since the word has several meanings in geographie, IT, linguistics, biology, philosophy etc.</p>
    <p>That's how Perry somehow established and stuck to me. And when I hear Perry, I think of one of my favourite shows from childhood - Phineas and Ferb. 
        Perry is their teal colored Platypus, who apparently doesn't do much but actually has a secret
        life as a special agent, fighting his evil nemesis Dr. Doofenschmirz. 
    </p>
    <p>Since then I've decided to make Perry my kind of emotional support / spirit animal on my way to becoming a programmer.</p>
